Task4:-Given a year, find if it is a leap year. Leap year is the year that is multiple of 4. But, multiples of 100 which are not multiples of 400 are not leap years.
Output:-
Return 1 if the year is a leap year else return 0.


static int LeapYear(int year){
if (((year%4==0) && (year%100!=0)) || (year%400==0))  // this || is or function which works like OR gate
return 1;
else{
    return 0;
}
}
